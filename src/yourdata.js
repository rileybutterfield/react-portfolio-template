  // About Secton --------------
  aboutParaOne:
    "Before transitioning into tech, I worked as an educator. I was introduced to the tech world when I was working as a Web Development Program Manager at an education non-profit. I was immediately fascinated by the power of code. I started with self-guided learning, focusing primarily on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I fell more in love with code with each line I wrote and, eventually, decided to make the leap into tech for good.",
  aboutParaTwo:
    "In August 2020, I had my first day of classes with the Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy, a highly selective coding bootcamp for women and non-binary people. At Grace Hopper, I deepened my existing skills and was certified in the NERP (Node.js, Express.js, React, PostgreSQL) stack. Before I knew it, I was dreaming in code. Now, I am working as a Software Engineering Fellow at Fullstack Academy, where I serve as a technical manager for student projects, lead weekly code reviews, instruct on data structures and algorithms, and run technical admissions interviews.",
  aboutParaThree:
    "When I'm not learning new tech (I'm learning TypeScript now!), you can find me curating Spotify playlists, watching reruns of Jeopardy, or admiring the beauty of NYC.",
